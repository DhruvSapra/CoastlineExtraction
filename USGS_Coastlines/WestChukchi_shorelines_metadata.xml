      <abstract>This dataset includes shorelines that span 68 years, from 1948 to 2016, for the north coast of Alaska from Icy Cape to Cape Prince of Wales. Shorelines were compiled from topographic survey sheets (T-sheets; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)) and aerial orthophotographs (U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Alaska High Altitude Photography (AHAP)). Historical shoreline positions serve as easily understood features that can be used to describe the movement of beaches through time. These data are used to calculate rates of shoreline change for the U.S. Geological Survey's National Assessment of Shoreline Change Project. Rates of long-term and short-term shoreline change were generated in a GIS using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.4. DSAS uses a measurement baseline method to calculate rate-of-change statistics. Transects are cast from the reference baseline to intersect each shoreline, establishing measurement points used to calculate shoreline change rates.</abstract>
      <purpose>Beach erosion is a persistent problem along most open-ocean shores of the United States. Along the Arctic coast of Alaska, coastal erosion is widespread and is threatens Native communities, defense and energy-related infrastructure, and coastal habitat. As coastal populations continue to expand and infrastructure and habitat are increasingly threatened by erosion, there is increased demand for accurate information regarding past and present trends and rates of shoreline movement. There also is a need for a comprehensive analysis of shoreline change with metrics that are consistent from one coastal region to another. To meet these national needs, the U.S. Geological Survey is conducting an analysis of historical shoreline changes along the open-ocean sandy shores of the conterminous United States and parts of Hawaii, Alaska, and the Great Lakes. One purpose of this work is to develop standard, repeatable methods for mapping and analyzing shoreline change so that periodic, systematic, and internally consistent updates regarding coastal erosion and land loss can be made nationally.</purpose>

      <attraccr>The attributes in this table record positional and measurement uncertainties and datum offsets calculated during the process of extracting a land/water interface shoreline from the orthoimagery data as described in the process steps. The field names are based on the requirements for use within the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software (USGS Open-File Report 2008-1278).</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Adjacent shoreline segments do not overlap and are not necessarily continuous. Shorelines were quality checked for accuracy. Any slight offsets between adjacent segments due to georeferencing and digitizing error are taken into account in the uncertainty calculations included in Gibbs and others (2019).</logic>
    <complete>This shoreline file is complete and contains all shoreline segments used to calculate shoreline change rates along sections of the specified Alaska coastal region where shoreline position data were available. These data adequately represented the shoreline position at the time of the survey. Remaining gaps in these data are a consequence of nonexisting data or existing data that did not meet quality assurance standards.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Shoreline data have been acquired from 1948 to 2016, the horizontal accuracy of which varies with respect to the data source from which the shorelines were digitized and the time period. Shorelines digitized from the 1980s era Alaska High Altitude Photography (AHAP) have an estimated shoreline position uncertainty of plus or minus 10.4 to 22.4 meters. Shorelines digitized from the 1940s and 1950s era T-sheets have an estimated total shoreline position uncertainty of plus or minus 15.7 meters. Shorelines digitized from 2016 orthophotographs have an estimated total shoreline position uncertainty of plus or minus 2.1 to 3.8 meters. Shorelines used in this analysis that were published in Lestak and others (2010) have an estimated total shoreline position uncertainty ranging from 2.3 to 2.9 meters, 2.2 to 2.7 meters, and 1.7 to 1.0 meters for orthoimagery collected in the 1950s, 1980s, and 2003, respectively. Please visit the 'Estimation of Shoreline Position Uncertainty' section in Gibbs and others (2019) for a complete explanation of the measurement uncertainties associated with these shorelines.</horizpar>
